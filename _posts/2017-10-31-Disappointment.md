My employer laid a bunch off people yesterday. While I still have a 
job, this makes me really sad. I feel bad for those people that didn't 
have a job to go to this morning - some of them have worked here a 
long time, some of them are good friends, some acquaintances, some 
I can't really say I know.

I'm sure they will find good jobs elsewhere - unemployment here in 
Iceland is very low these days, but then again, there aren't that 
many game developers. For some, this will mean not only changing 
jobs, but moving to a different country, on a very short notice. 
While that can be exciting, it can also be very upsetting.

I mostly feel disappointed. I really believed this company had 
evolved past this sort of behavior. We've seen layoffs here 
before - it was painful, and we've really made an effort of 
avoiding getting ourselves into this situation. Or so I thought.

Shifting focus is sometimes - often, maybe - necessary. I just 
wish companies could do that without letting people go.
