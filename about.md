I am a software architect at CCP Games. Work on the launcher, Wine 
support, graphics engine and other random stuff for EVE Online, 
usually low level. This blog details some interesting things I run 
into at work, as well as new things I'm trying out in my spare time. 
Lately I've been picking up new programming languages - 
Erlang/Elixir, Go, Swift whereas most of my work in the past is in 
C++ and Python.
