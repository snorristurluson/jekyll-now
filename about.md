I am a former software architect at CCP Games. Worked on the launcher, Wine 
support, graphics engine and other random stuff for EVE Online, 
usually low level. This blog details some interesting things I've run 
into at work, as well as new things I'm trying out in my spare time. 
Most recently I'm playing around with Vulkan, and lately I've been picking up 
new programming languages - Erlang/Elixir, Go, Swift whereas most of my work in 
the past is in C++ and Python.
